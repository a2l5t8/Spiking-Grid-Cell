# Spiking Grid Cell Model

Welcome to the **Spiking Grid Cell** repository! This project implements a biologically plausible model of spiking grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) of the hippocampus and potentially in the Layer 6 (L6) of the cortical column in the neocortex.

## Overview

Grid cells in the MEC are crucial for spatial navigation and memory. Our proposed model utilizes spiking neural networks to simulate the activity patterns of grid cells based on the frameworks provided by **PyTorch**, **PyMNNtorch**, and **cnrl-conex**. This repository aims to bridge the gap between biological findings and computational neuroscience by presenting a spiking model that could better emulate the grid cell activities observed in vivo.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies listed below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spiking-grid-cell.git
cd spiking-grid-cell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following frameworks:

- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **PyMNNtorch**: A framework for simulating spiking neural networks.
- **cnrl-conex**: A library for continuous neural representations and extensions.

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher and the latest versions of the following packages:

```text
torch>=1.9.0
pymonntorch>=0.2.2
cnrl-conex>=1.0.0
```

## Usage

The repository contains scripts to train and evaluate the spiking grid cell model. To run the model, navigate to the main directory and execute:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

For a detailed example, see the `examples/` directory which contains:

- **final-grid.ipynb**: A minimal example to demonstrate the basic setup and grid cell firing patterns.
- **grid-modules.py**: A comprehensive simulation using biological parameters and testing out different results.

## Model Details

Our model is based on the recent neuroscience findings and aims to replicate the following:

- **Spiking Dynamics**: Using CoNeX to create networks of spiking Leaky-Intergrate & Fire (LIF) neurons.
- **Grid Cell Patterns**: Formation of hexagonal firing patterns as described in the biological literature using Continous Attractor Network (CAN) model and Lateral Inhibition.

### Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) and Cortical Column

The Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) and possibly the Layer 6 (L6) of the cortical column in the neocortex are regions hypothesized to contain grid cells. These cells are responsible for generating a spatial representation of the environment, which is crucial for navigation and memory tasks. Our model attempts to provide insights into these representations using spiking neural networks.
